Analysis: Analyze the frequency of each medical condition across different patient demographics. Bucket the demographics to make it presentable to high-level management. Ensure not to create too many buckets and make the buckets mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.

2. Patient Price Optimization

Objective: Identify trends in the data and recommend ways for patients to reduce their cost.
Analysis: Calculate the average billing amount for different metrics. Determine if certain metrics consistently result in higher or lower healthcare costs. Try to relate it back to findings from the demographic analysis.
